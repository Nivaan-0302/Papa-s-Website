        Papa is my Best Friend. He was there when corona struck all of us.He himself was positive was positive but he had to forget he was positive and used to take care of us day and night. Although in Papa's RTPCR Test his reports were negative but in his HRCT Test his reports were positive. He used to make our breakfast, lunch and dinner. We used to have a small table in front of our doors on which Papa would keep our meals of the day. I love my Papa and Papa loves me too and along with that he loves my nose. He gets everything whatever I told him to and if I don't tell him also he understands what I want. Whenever I need his help he gives me ideas and suggesions. I love my Papa and I always will.
